# Tech Notes Repository

Welcome to the Tech Notes repository! This project is designed to serve as a collection of concise and easy-to-understand notes on various technologies. The goal is to provide a helpful reference for individuals looking to learn or quickly grasp the essentials of different tools and frameworks.

## Purpose

This repository aims to simplify the learning process by offering focused notes, code snippets, and setup instructions for a range of technologies. Whether you're a beginner exploring a new language or an experienced developer needing a quick reminder, these notes are intended to be a valuable resource.

## Technologies Covered

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the local copy. Then, run the following command, replacing `<your-github-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of your forked repository (which will likely be `Tech-Notes`):

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-github-username>/<repository-name>.git
