Nice — you're absolutely leveling up your API skills in SvelteKit! Let’s break this **PATCH request** implementation into a neat summary, so you can refer back to it easily when needed.

## 🔧 PATCH Requests in SvelteKit

The PATCH method is used to **partially update** a resource. In our case, it’s a comment — specifically, its `text`.

---

## 🛠️ File Structure Recap

The dynamic API route for updating a comment by ID lives here:

```
src/
└── routes/
    └── api/
        └── comments/
            └── [commentId]/
                └── +server.js
```

---

## 🧠 The Code: Handling PATCH Requests

```js
import { comments } from "$lib/comments.js";
import { json } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export async function PATCH({ params, request }) {
  const { commentId } = params;
  const { text } = await request.json();

  const comment = comments.find((c) => c.id === parseInt(commentId));

  if (!comment) {
    return json({ message: "Comment not found" }, { status: 404 });
  }

  comment.text = text;

  return json(comment);
}
```

### 💬 What's Happening:

- `params.commentId` gets the ID from the URL.
- `await request.json()` gets the PATCH body (`{ text: 'updated comment' }`).
- We find the matching comment in the `comments` array.
- If found, we update its `text` property.
- Return the updated comment as JSON.

## ⚡ Testing It in Thunder Client

1. **Method:** `PATCH`
2. **URL:**  
   `http://[::1]:5173/api/comments/4`
3. **Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "text": "updated comment"
}
```

4. ✅ **Hit Send**: You should see `200 OK` and the updated comment.

---

## ✅ Final Result

- The comment with `id: 4` now has the updated text.
- A GET request to `/api/comments` confirms it.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Add Error Handling (optional)

Add basic validation if someone sends an empty text:

```js
if (!text || text.trim() === "") {
  return json({ message: "Text is required" }, { status: 400 });
}
```
