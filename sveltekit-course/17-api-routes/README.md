Here’s a clean and structured **summary of API routes in SvelteKit**, based on your walkthrough:

# 🚀 Introduction to API Routes in SvelteKit

SvelteKit lets you build **RESTful APIs** directly inside your project, just like page routes — no need for a separate backend!

---

## 🔄 Page Routes vs. API Routes

| Feature          | Page Routes (`+page.svelte`) | API Routes (`+server.js`)              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose          | Render HTML pages            | Return data (JSON, text, etc.)         |
| Browser visible? | Yes                          | No (server-side only)                  |
| Use case         | Frontend views               | Backend logic, DB calls, external APIs |

---

## ✅ Benefits of API Routes in SvelteKit

- Built-in server logic — no external server like Express needed
- Can handle **CRUD operations**
- Perfect for calling **external APIs with secret keys** (safe from browser)
- Follows simple conventions for setup

## 🛠️ Creating Your First API Route

### 1. Inside `src/routes/`, create a new folder

🗂️ `src/routes/demo-api`

### 2. Add the API handler file

📄 `+server.js`

### 3. Add a basic GET handler

```js
// src/routes/demo-api/+server.js

export function GET() {
  return new Response("Hello from the demo API");
}
```

> You must use the **HTTP method names in all caps** (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), and export them as functions.

---

## 🧪 Test It Out

Visit:

```
http://localhost:5173/demo-api
```

You’ll see:

```
Hello from the demo API
```

🎉 Your first backend API route is live!

---

## 🧠 What to Remember

- API routes live in the `routes/` folder, just like page routes
- Use `+server.js` or `+server.ts` to define them
- Export functions named `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.
- You can return plain text, JSON, or any custom `Response`
- These are **server-only**: perfect for protecting secret data like API keys

---

## 🔜 Coming Up Next

You’ll explore how to:

- Handle `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests
- Parse request bodies
- Return JSON responses
- Work with form data or external APIs

Let me know if you want me to break down the next one — `POST` request handling — in the same format!
