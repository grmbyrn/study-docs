Here's a clean breakdown of what you've covered so far, focused on handling **GET requests in SvelteKit API routes**, with a handy reference-style summary:

# 📡 Handling GET Requests in SvelteKit API Routes

SvelteKit makes it easy to set up API routes that return data. In this guide, we learn how to respond to **GET requests** with mock data.

---

## 🧪 Testing APIs: Use Thunder Client

Install the **Thunder Client** extension in VS Code — a lightweight REST client that makes API testing a breeze.

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Mock Data

In `src/lib/comments.js` (or `.ts`):

```js
// src/lib/comments.js
export const comments = [
  { id: 1, text: "Great video, thanks!" },
  { id: 2, text: "Could you cover form validation next?" },
  { id: 3, text: "Subscribed for more!" },
];
```

### 2. Create API Folder Structure

Following a convention:

```
src/
└── routes/
    └── api/
        └── comments/
            └── +server.js
```

### 3. Add GET Handler

```js
// src/routes/api/comments/+server.js
import { comments } from "$lib/comments.js";
import { json } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export function GET() {
  return json(comments);
}
```

- `json()` is a helper from SvelteKit to return proper JSON responses.
- `comments` is returned as the response body.

## 🧪 Testing with Thunder Client

### Request Setup:

- **Method**: GET
- **URL**: `http://[::1]:5173/api/comments`

> If `localhost:5173` fails with “connection refused”, use `[::1]` (IPv6 loopback) instead.

### Response:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "text": "Great video, thanks!" },
  { "id": 2, "text": "Could you cover form validation next?" },
  { "id": 3, "text": "Subscribed for more!" }
]
```

✅ Status: 200 OK  
🎉 Your GET endpoint is working!

---

## 📌 Recap

- API routes use `+server.js` files.
- Use `GET()` to handle GET requests.
- Use `json()` to return data properly.
- `lib/` is great for storing shared logic and mock data.

Up next: **POST requests** — where the fun of sending and saving data begins!
